# tufte-latex-mit

This is a PhD thesis template based on [Tiff](ttseng/tufte-latex-mit)'s version of the [MIT's LaTeX thesis template](http://web.mit.edu/thesis/tex/) and the [Tufte-LaTeX] (https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) template. It supports margin figures! Great for small or narrow figures that would otherwise take a lot of space from the main body of text. 

Main differences between this version and [Tiff](ttseng/tufte-latex-mit)'s:
- The first page of each chapter shows the chapter number in a very big font above the title, similar to the [classicthesis template](https://bitbucket.org/amiede/classicthesis/wiki/Home).
- Section titles have a bigger font, are not italized, and are preceded by the section number.
- It supports _Parts_ (e.g. Part I, Part II), which also appear in the table of contents.
- The table of content shows the section numbers next to their titles.
- The table of content separates chapter and section numbers from their titles with an indentation. 
- The cover is very simple and doesn't show any university-specific information (for MIT's version, check [Tiff](ttseng/tufte-latex-mit)'s template).

Check out main.pdf for a preview of what it looks like.
